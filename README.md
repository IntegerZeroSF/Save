# Save

Save is a place where you can capture notes and to do lists to keep track of your thoughts.

## Functionality

Full CRUD is working on both models.  There are two models, List and Items.  Each list holds multiple items.   

We worked on having the redirect from item create/update/delete send you back to the list_detail page.  So no item_create/update.html templates were needed.

Due to list being a reserved word in Django, we used _list in it's place.

## To be worked on:

- priority of each item
    - colors?
- alarm/time to complete by
- mark items as complete
- set up user login
- search bar
- css
